"1st Quadrant": if  +x,+y
"2nd Quadrant": if -x,+y
"3rd Quadrant": if -x,-y
"4th Quadrant": if +x,-y
"x axis": if x,0
"y axis": if 0,y
"Origin": if 0,0
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
5 100
Sample Output 1 :
1st Quadrant
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Both x and y are positive so the point lies in 1st Quadrant.
Sample Input 2 :
0 -80
Sample Output 2 :
y axis
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
 Since x is 0 the point lies in y-axis.
Sample Input 3 :
-2 40
Sample Output 3 :
2nd Quadrant
Explanation of Sample Input 3:
Since x is negative and y is positive the point lies in 2nd Quadrant.
